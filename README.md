### Short description
 This game is based of the manga genre, "Isekai", Isekai is a genre where the Main Character gets transported to a different world that in no way, shape or form represents the good old "Earth". For example, it's a world with swords & magic, or it's a world with the best technology known to mankind.

 In this game/story, you are that Main Character!
 This game is quite based on your own choses as well, so make the right choices!
